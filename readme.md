## Project Description 
This project is a learning-focused contact management application designed to build foundational skills in developing full-stack web applications with Node.js and Express.js. It features a RESTful API backend that supports full CRUD operations, with MongoDB as the database for persistent storage. The frontend is built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to maintain a lightweight, responsive interface.

The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with:

- Setting up and structuring an Express application
- Designing and implementing RESTful APIs
- Connecting and interacting with a MongoDB database using Mongoose
- Processing form data and server-side rendering techniques

This app serves as a practical introduction to building server-side applications and managing data-driven user interfaces without relying on front-end frameworks.

## Status
ðŸš§ This project is currently in active development.
Not all features are implemented yet, and the app is not fully functional.


## Features
**View Contacts**  
Displays a list of all contacts stored in the database, with basic details such as name and group associations.

**Create and Edit Contacts**  
Users can create new contacts or edit existing ones using dedicated form pages, with group assignment options.

**Group Management Interface**  
Provides a page for adding and viewing groups, allowing users to organize contacts into categories.

**Cancel Button Functionality**  
Includes a cancel button on the group management page that dynamically returns users to the appropriate contacts form.

**Full Contact Management (CRUD)**

Create, view, update, and delete contacts with details such as name, email, and phone number.

**User-Defined Groups**

Organize contacts into custom groups (e.g., Family, Friends, Work) that users can create, edit, and delete as needed.

**Group-Based Filtering**

Filter the main contact list by group using a dropdown menu, making it easy to view contacts by category.

**Form Validation**

Includes server-side validation to ensure data integrity (e.g., required fields, valid email format).

**Error Handling**

Displays user-friendly error messages for invalid input, missing data, or database-related issues.

**RESTful API Architecture**

Follows RESTful design principles for route structure and resource handling.

**MongoDB Data Storage**

Uses MongoDB and Mongoose to store and manage contacts and groups in a flexible, schema-based database.

**Simple and Responsive UI**

Built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for a lightweight, accessible interface with no frontend frameworks.

## What I Learned

This project was a hands-on opportunity to apply foundational skills in full-stack JavaScript development. Key takeaways include:
	- Built an Express.js app independently without following a tutorial, reinforcing my understanding of routing, middleware, and server-side architecture.
	- Gained familiarity with middleware tools such as express-session, connect-flash, method-override, and ejs-mate for layout templating.
	- Learned to use technical documentation effectively, particularly for implementing express-validator for server-side form validation.
	- Practiced writing structured documentation, including clear installation steps, feature descriptions, and API overviews.
	- Improved version control workflow using Git and GitHub to track progress, manage changes, and structure the project repository professionally.
